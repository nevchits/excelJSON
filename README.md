# excelJSON

My research on how to create an online directory using data collected from an excel file, converted to a json and then displayed on a web page, served by nodeJS
The node module files was not uploaded, so you will have to npm install express if you want to run the node version of this code.

I actually used Bing ChatGPT for most of the code, with a bit of tweaking here and there
